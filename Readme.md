# Web- Programming Solutions

>This repository contains a collection of simple HTML and CSS files for practicing and experimenting with web development concepts.

## Structure

- Multiple HTML and CSS file pairs (e.g., `1.html`/`1.css`, `2421.html`/`2421.css`, etc.)
- A main `index.html` file
- A `style.css` file for general styles
- A `qs/` directory (purpose unspecified)

## Usage

Open any HTML file in your browser to view the corresponding web page. Each HTML file is typically paired with a CSS file of the same name for styling.

This workspace is ideal for:
- Practicing HTML and CSS basics
- Experimenting with layouts and styles
- Learning by example with multiple small projects

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the folder in your code editor.
3. Open any `.html` file in your browser to see the result.

## Notes

- Each HTML file may demonstrate different web development techniques.
- The `qs/` folder may contain additional resources or exercises.

Feel free to modify or add new files for further practice!
